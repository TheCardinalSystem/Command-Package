# Command-Package

This library was designed to make setting up commands for Discord bots a simple and easy task. I wanted a library that would take care of command identification and argument processing. The end product was something much bigger. This library includes all of the following and saves users the time of setting up their own command frameworks:

* Command identification
* Command authorization
* Command categorization
* Argument processing
* Data management
* Guild Properties
* User properties
* Message Formatting
* Concurrent event handling
* Error handling

This library also includes some simple utility classes which are useful for common tasks (such as randomization, string formatting, comparisons, etc).
